      <h1>Hi, I'm Luke Lechel</h1>
      <p>I'm passionate about improving my workflow, exploring new products and ideas, and exceeding the expectations of those around me.</p>
      <h2>Experience and Skills</h2>
      <div class="xpSkills">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Electronics Consultative Sales</strong> Working in a retail environment has taught me to discern and fulfill customer needs, quickly progress with a team, and complete tasks even more efficiently.</li>
          <li><strong>Regularly Converse With Neighbors in an Education Work</strong> I regularly volunteer my time to offer free personal Bible studies to anyone in the community that wants one. My regular involvement in this work teaches me how to interact well and develop relationships with people that I haven’t met before.</li>
          <li><strong>Vast Knowledge Array</strong> From phone specs to basic web development, photography to writing, my interests are widely spread. Exploring and experimenting in so many fields has enabled me to have some experience in a wide subject gamut.</li>
          <li><strong>Assist Friends and Family With Products</strong> I fundamentally believe that learning anything requires a great deal of curiosity. By assisting friends and family with setup, troubleshooting, and understanding of their devices, I’ve become familiar with the intimate details of such platforms as OS X, iOS, Android, and Windows.</li>
          <li><strong>Attended Producer Workshop</strong> This seminar, part of the Traverse City Film Festival, was taught by Carl Deal and Tia Lessin, producers of "<a href="http://youtu.be/kQ3vZzZvrcY">Fahrenheit 9/11</a>" and "<a href="https://youtu.be/Cq426VjZD1E">Trouble the Water</a>".</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Graduated early from <a href="http://www.connectionsacademy.com">Connections Academy</a> — 2012 - 2015.</p>
