      <li>"We are the music-makers, / And we are the dreamers of dreams, /
Wandering by lone sea-breakers, / And sitting by desolate streams. /
World-losers and world-forsakers, / Upon whom the pale moon gleams; /
Yet we are the movers and shakers, / Of the world forever, it seems. /

With our wonderful, deathless ditties, / We built up the world's great cities. /
And out of a fabulous story, / We fashion an empire's glory. /
One man with a dream, at pleasure, / Shall go forth and conquer a crown, /
And three with a new song's measure, / Can trample an empire down."

Everyday I want to be there.

They will come true sooner than you can imagine."

In the dark,
Found light
Brighter than many never see.

From her dower:
The message of strength
Of inner power."

For want of a battle the kingdom was lost.
All for the want of a horseshoe nail."

      <li>"She came from the ocean,
this wild girl from the sea,
her hair flowing southwards,
she walked towards me.

A west to east smile,
with eyes steely grey,
like a storm in the distance,
rolling in from the bay.

We kissed with the sunrise,
made love when it set,
a promise by moonlight,
came dawn, my regret.

He left for the ocean,
this boy from the land,
his spirit soars northward,
his heart in her hands."
- "The Mermaid" by Michael Faudet</li>

      <li>"Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do."
- Steve Jobs</li>
          <br>
      <li>"Come live with me, and be my love,
And we will some new pleasures prove.
Of golden sands, and crystal brooks,
With silken lines, and silver hooks.

There will the river whispering run
Warm'd by thy eyes, more than the sun;
And there the 'enamour'd fish will stay,
Begging themselves they may betray."
- John Donne</li>
          <br>
      <li>"It is almost a definition of a gentleman to say he is one who never inflicts pain. This description is both refined and, as far as it goes, accurate. … From a long-sighted prudence, he observes the maxim of the ancient sage, that we should ever conduct ourselves towards our enemy as if he were one day to be our friend."
- John Henry Cardinal Newman</li>
          <br>
      <li>"It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude."

      <li>"Past the blazin' mini-boss, in the library twas blackened.
The information now is lost, the cinders hot and cracked.
But through the heat true fire shines, the spirit of a warrior
To rescue sheepskin from a shrine, the goal of this lone courier.
Joe Hills is his name, and completion - his quest.
Not even Vechs can quench his flame, for he is among the best.
So bring your worst in this cave, for he cannot be beat.
Soon victory shall cease his crave, the monument complete."
- "BeanBomb47"</li>
